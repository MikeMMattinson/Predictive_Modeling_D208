# Learning Pandas - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Learning Pandas - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-pandas-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787123137), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
You will learn how to use pandas to perform data analysis in Python. You will start with an overview of data analysis and iteratively progress from modeling data, to accessing data from remote sources, performing numeric and statistical analysis, through indexing and performing aggregate analysis, and finally to visualizing statistical data and applying pandas to finance.

With the knowledge you gain from this book, you will quickly learn pandas and how it can empower you in the exciting world of data manipulation, analysis and science.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
Code words in text are shown as follows: 
```
"This information can be easily imported into DataFrame using the pd.read_csv()  function as follows."
```

A block of code entered in a Python interpreter is set as follows:
```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame.from_items([('column1', [1, 2, 3])])
print (df)
```

This book assumes some familiarity with programming concepts, but those without programming experience, or specifically Python programming experience, will be comfortable with the examples as they focus on pandas constructs more than Python or programming. The examples are based on Anaconda Python 2.7 and pandas 0.15.1. If you do not have either installed, guidance will be given in Chapter 2, Up and Running with pandas, regarding installing pandas on installing both on Windows, OSX, and Ubuntu systems. For those not interested in installing any software, instruction is also given on using the Warkari.io online Python data analysis service.
